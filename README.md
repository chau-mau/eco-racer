# Eco-Racer

Eco-Racer is a bioinformatics tool for the genetic characterization of silkworm ecoraces using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained through ddRAD sequencing. The tool identifies SNPs with high discriminatory power to differentiate between ecoraces and provides visualization and analysis options for genetic diversity studies.

## Features
- Identifies informative SNPs for ecorace discrimination.
- Processes ddRAD sequencing data.
- Generates visualizations for genetic diversity and population structure.
- User-friendly command-line interface for analyses.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chau-mau/eco-racer.git
cd eco-racer
